## If you are looking to contribute a template

This repository is used to store the starter templates. Wasp uses [giget](https://github.com/unjs/giget) in the background to download folders from this repository.

Users call the Wasp CLI with `wasp new <project-name> -t <template-name>` and then Wasp does the following:
1. Downloads the template folder
2. Replaces some placeholders in the `main.wasp`
  - Replaces `__waspProjectName__` and `__waspAppName__` with user provided `<project-name>`
  - Replaces `__waspVersion__` with the current Wasp CLI version
  
Adding new templates requires just creating a new folder in this repo, and putting the placeholders instead of the app name, `title` and `version`.
